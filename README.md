# 👋 Hey not Vsauce, @Souleymeine here. (How did you get here?)
### Socially awkward French dude who likes history, photography, running, languages, memes and programming.

- I'm currently *trying* to build a website which will contain all of my activities, projects, etc. My autobiography for short.
- Fun fact : **Souleymeine** is my name, not a pseudo. It stands for the correct pronounciation of "Souleymane", in Arabic "**سُلَيْمَان**". May be hard to pronounce for english natives though.
- I try to be productive as much as I can, but I've got a lot of difficulties those time. I'll be more active as the year passes. I'll keep you up to date (someone ever comes here).

## Medias :
- Almost dead, but will come back in few weeks : [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Souleymeine "idk")
- For artworks (~~shit posting~~) : [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/souleymeine_/ "More personal")
- Programming stuff : [My Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/souleymeine "Also dead")
