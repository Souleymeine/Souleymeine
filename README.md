# 👋 Hi, I’m @Souleymeine
### A 15 years old socialy akward introvert french dude who likes history, photography, running, languages, memes and programming.

- I'm currently *trying* to build a website which will contain all of my activities, projects, etc. My autobiography for short.
- Fun fact : **Souleymeine** is my name, not a pseudo. It stands for the correct pronounciation of "Souleymane", in arabic "**سُلَيْمَان**". May be hard to pronounce for english natives x')
- I try to be productive as much as I can, but I've got a lot of difficulties those time. Y'know, teenage years... I'll be more active as 2023 passes. I'll keep you up to date.
